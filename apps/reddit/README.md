# Reddit Thirtify app

App for Thirtify based on Reddit for Spicietify rewritten to be used with Thirtify App system.

** WORK IN PROGRESS **

## Installation

Put the bundle into **thirtify_app_folder**/apps/ folder (make the app folder if not exists)

Currently, as there is no app finder and manager yet integrated into Thirtify, for now, edit the index.html file and add this script tag

````html

	<script src="apps/reddit/js/main.js"></script>

````

Then browse to /app/reddit or enter 'spotify:app:reddit' in the search field.

Have fun!
